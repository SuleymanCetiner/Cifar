# Cifar10 Dataset

In this project,we handled CÄ°FAR 10 dataset.
There are lots of examples about image classification and we say that keras is a good tool to use.
Many types of images are seen in this dataset like car,zebra,duck,orange, etc.
We used colorful images so we highlight that dimension is (32,32,3) which has RGB colors.

Tensorflow has lots of datasets to handle but i think this can be used for me.
Selecting that dataset is important because you should be familiar with it.

There are 50000 labels so we can train this model with a large number of layers.
We recently used Dropout to increase accuracy and we tried to decrease loss for this training.
We noticed that this accuracy is not high but we interrupt traning process in intention.
