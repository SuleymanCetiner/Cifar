# Cifar

In this project,we handled CÄ°FAR 10 dataset.
There are lots of examples about image classification and we say that keras is a good tool to use.
Many types of images are seen in this dataset like car,zebra,duck,orange, etc.
We used colorful images so we highlight that dimension is (32,32,3) which has RGB colors.

Tensorflow has lots of datasets to handle but i think this can be used for me.
Selecting that dataset is important because you should be familiar with it.
